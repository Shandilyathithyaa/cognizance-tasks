# Approach
I found the task pretty easy except for the fact that I got stuck with the error:

I thought I could remove some unwanted style/display variables or something as suggested by one of my friends but it still didn't work.
I browsed stackoverflow and many other sites but only then I realised that me using the ubuntu terminal directly instead of through vb could be the issue.
So I copied the corrected code and ran it in vscode terminal where I had wsl extension and it worked pretty well.

The errors were pretty easy to correct as most of them were caught by the compiler and other few being logical errors like start instead of stop or +=23 instead of ++;
I did get one error rectified with help of my friend Yurekan who found that the conversion of milliseconds to seconds was wrong.
