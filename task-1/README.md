The task is to find the minimum no. of steps from 0 to x. The steps are in the order of 1-5 units; Assuming the elephant can take steps of 5/4/so on units continuously, if we 
divide the remaining distance to cover by the order of the units per step, we get no. of steps in the order of that unit. similarly we can find the no. of steps for each unit per 
step from 5 to 1 to find the result.
