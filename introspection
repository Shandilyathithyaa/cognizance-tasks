I am a CSE student and I think that serves a good reason from my side to join the club. But on a serious note, I find learning things through tasks with peers, helping each other
is interesting and a fun xp. So kudos :)

For the next 6 months I'm thinking of trying different things, basics of different domains and I wish to learn few things that I have planned to and start putting it to use 
through various events.

I can manage the club and help in conducting tasks or things that are done by the seniors of mine who are currently managing the club.
