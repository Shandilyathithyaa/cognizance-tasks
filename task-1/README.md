# Approach
The task is to find the minimum no. of steps from 0 to x. The steps are in the order of 1-5 units; Assuming the elephant can take steps of 5/4/... units continuously, if we 
divide the remaining distance to cover by the units per step, we get no. of steps in the order of those units per step. similarly we can find the no. of steps for each units per 
step i.e. from 5 to 1 to find the result.
