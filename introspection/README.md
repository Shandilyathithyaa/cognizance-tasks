As a CSE student who is pretty excited to learn new things, I hope I can acquire some knowledge that might be missed by the college curriculum. I find learning things through tasks with peers and helping each other interesting and a fun xp.

For the next 6 months I'm thinking of trying different things, basics of different domains and I wish to learn few things that I have planned to and start putting it to use by participating in various events.

I can manage the club and help in conducting tasks or things that are done currently by my seniors who are managing the club. I am also open to share my knowledge for who seeks it and help my peers or juniors in future or maybe even seniors :)
