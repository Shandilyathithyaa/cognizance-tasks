# Approach
The task was easy once finished but seemed a little hard when starting. Browsed how to get github repos through terminal which lead me to use 'curl'.
Then I created a separate python script for getting the specific key-value pair which had the repositories' url path from a separate json file.
Then I just put together the curl command and perceval command in the .py file using os module.
